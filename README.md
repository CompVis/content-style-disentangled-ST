**This is a working version of the code. Updates are coming. Pretrained models too.**

### Requirements
- python 3.6
- tensorflow 1.13.1
- PIL, numpy, scipy
- tqdm



### Training 
1) Download Places365 to use it as a content dataset: [Places365-Standard high-res train mages (105GB)](http://data.csail.mit.edu/places/places365/train_large_places365standard.tar).  
2) Download a couple of artists images from [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yUgP4s6tgOC91fcL94cN2ocOqk7JUol9).
We recommend taking first collection of Cezanne and Van Gogh images. 
Place them in folders `./data/art_images/cezanne_vangogh/cezanne` and 
`./data/art_images/cezanne_vangogh/vangogh` respectively.
3) To start training run in terminal `bash launch_multistep_training.sh`. 
This script starts training with default parameters for loss weighting and default 
learning schedule. You may want to change them depending on the data you are using.
For parameters description see main.py file.
